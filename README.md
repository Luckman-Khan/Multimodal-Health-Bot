# DocTalk: Your Multilingual AI Health Assistant

A multilingual, multimodal AI health assistant on WhatsApp, designed to provide accessible, personalized, and proactive preventive healthcare information to rural and semi-urban populations in India.

## üöÄ The Problem

Access to clear, simple, and timely healthcare information is a significant challenge in rural India. Barriers include literacy levels, language diversity, and a lack of immediate access to medical professionals for simple queries. This creates a gap where misinformation can thrive and preventive care is often overlooked.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**Doc-Dost** is an intelligent WhatsApp chatbot powered by Google's Gemini Pro model and a persistent Firebase database. It bridges the information gap by acting as a personal, stateful health companion.

It allows users to:
-   Converse naturally in multiple languages (English, Hinglish, Hindi, Bengali, Odia).
-   Receive personalized, location-based health alerts.
-   Generate and save a personalized child vaccination schedule.
-   Send pictures of medicines or symptoms for analysis.
-   Provide feedback to continuously improve the service.

## üìã Key Features

-   **Intelligent Multilingual Support**: Automatically detects and remembers a user's language for a seamless conversational experience.
-   **Multimodal Input**: Understands both text queries and images, allowing users to **show** what's wrong, not just describe it.
-   **Personalized Health Alerts**: Users can set their district to receive simulated real-time alerts about local disease outbreaks.
-   **Interactive Vaccination Scheduler**: A conversational, multi-step feature that:
    -   Asks for a child's date of birth.
    -   Generates a complete, personalized vaccination schedule with exact due dates.
    -   Saves the schedule to the user's profile for future reminders.
-   **Stateful Memory**: Utilizes a Firebase database to remember user preferences (language, district) and conversational context (like waiting for a date of birth), making interactions feel natural and intelligent.
-   **User Feedback Loop**: A `feedback` command allows users to submit their suggestions, which are saved directly to the database for future analysis and improvement.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: The bot is designed to be resilient, providing helpful guidance to the user even if an input is incorrect or an API fails.
